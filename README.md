I am planning a  vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii and though some weather analysis would help .
By looking at weather station data I will be able to select the most likely to find weather that I would enjoy.
These are the steps I followed to accomplish the task.

    - Use resources folder and starter notebook to connect sqllite database
    -Reflect tables into classes and saved a reference as Station and Measurement
    -designed queries to 
        -retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data
        -calculate the number of stations
        -find the most active station
    -designed a Flask API based on queries developed
